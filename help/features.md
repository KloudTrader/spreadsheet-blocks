# Features

## Copy to clipboard
When you click on the *Create* button the formula will be copied to the clipboard.
No need for Ctrl+C, you can just paste it to Excel.

## Export and import
You can save the workspace to XML (`.sb`) and open from XML (`.sb`) via the menu in the top right corner.
These files can be moved online or with external storage.

## Backup and restore
The workspace (including the inactive blocks) is automatically saved into the local storage of the browser in every 10 seconds.
The previous workspace will be restored on the next page load.
This feature is intended to protect your work from accidents (window close, system failure, etc.)
**Do not** rely on this feature to save your code for later use!
