## Copy to clipboard
When you click on the *Create* button the formula will be copied to the clipboard.
No need for Ctrl+C, you can just paste it to Excel.

## Save and restore
The workspace (even the inactive blocks) is automatically saved into the local storage of the browser in every 10 seconds.
Currently it is not possible to save the workspace manually.

The previous workspace will be restored on the next page load from the local storage.
Currently it is not possible to manually load the workspace from an external file.
